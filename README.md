#### **Digital-Sport-Market**

#
##### *Scope of the Project* 
#
###### The proposed mobile application aims to provide both users and sports complexes with a user-friendly, convenient platform where sports  complexes can display their available facilities, such as badminton courts, basketball courts, gyms, and swimming pools.
#
######  The sports complexes will be capable of updating their real-time availability and reserved, unavailable time slots for each facility offered. Users can search for facilities that are closest to them by location, go through facilities, view the availability of facilities, and request bookings for available time slots directly through the mobile application. With the proposed platform, the standard process of booking an available time slot of a facility will be made more convenient and efficient.
